### ⏳ Pending: App Screenshots

Need to create before/after screenshots showing the organizer's power:

**BEFORE Screenshot:**
- Current view showing "2322 books in Unorganized"
- Demonstrates the problem: overwhelming chaos
- ✅ Already captured

**AFTER Screenshot:**
- Same library organized into compelling columns
- Demonstrates the solution: order and control
- ⏳ **Needs to be created after organizing library**

## Screenshot Strategy Guide

### Recommended Column Configuration

Create 4-5 columns with these themes (left to right):

#### Column 1: "Next to Read" (8-10 books)
- Eye of Time (Adrian Cousins) - 4.4★
- 1984 (Jason Ayres) - 4.6★
- From Chef to Crafter (Gabriel Rathweg) - 4.4★
- Operation Paperclip (Annie Jacobsen) - 4.7★
- Middle Falls Time Favorites - 4.8★
- Things My Son Needs to Know (Backman) - 4.5★

#### Column 2: "Time Travel" (6-8 books)
- Eye of Time
- 1984: A Year in the Life of Nobby Clarke
- Middle Falls Time Favorites
- (Add other time travel themed books from your library)

#### Column 3: "Thrillers" (8-10 books)
- The Enemy Within (Larry Bond)
- Necroscope: Avengers (Brian Lumley) - 4.4★
- Operation Paperclip
- Failure Is Not an Option (Gene Kranz)

#### Column 4: "Favorites ⭐" (5-7 books)
**Only books rated 4.5★ or higher:**
- Middle Falls - 4.8★
- Operation Paperclip - 4.7★
- 1984 - 4.6★
- Things My Son Needs to Know - 4.5★

#### Column 5: "Currently Reading" (2-3 books)
- Pick 2-3 books you're actively reading
- Keep this column small for realism

### Why This Configuration Works

✅ **Shows power**: Multiple organization methods (genre, status, rating)
✅ **Shows flexibility**: Same book can appear in multiple columns
✅ **Shows scale**: "2322 books" → organized into manageable groups
✅ **Visual appeal**: Mix of colorful covers across columns
✅ **Emotional impact**: Chaos → Control

### Screenshot Capture Tips

**Zoom Level** - Adjust so you can see:
- The ReaderWrangler header (logo, search, buttons)
- 4-5 columns visible horizontally
- At least 2-3 rows of books per column
- Enough books to show the scale

**What Makes It Compelling:**
- Empty or nearly-empty "Unorganized" column (shows completion)
- Multiple populated columns (shows different org methods)
- Visible book ratings with yellow stars
- Clean, organized appearance vs chaos of 2322 unsorted books

### Where to Use Each Image

| Image Type | Usage | Notes |
|------------|-------|-------|
| **Before screenshot** | Documentation, blog posts | Shows the problem |
| **After screenshot** | README.md hero, index.html hero, GitHub social preview | Shows the solution |
| **og-image.png** | Social media previews (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn) | Current logo design |
| **Logo/Favicon** | Site branding | Existing icons |

## Workflow: Next Steps

### Step 1: Review Documentation Changes ⏳
1. Review all modified files listed above
2. Review OG meta tag implementation
3. Confirm messaging changes align with brand
4. Decide whether to add OG tags to readerwrangler.html (optional)

### Step 2: Organize Library & Capture Screenshot ⏳
1. Organize books into column structure (see screenshot guide above)
2. Capture AFTER screenshot
3. Save both BEFORE and AFTER to images/ folder
4. Optionally update README/index.html to use new screenshots

### Step 3: Test OG Tags (After Push) ⏳
Test with social media validators:
- Facebook debugger: https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/
- Twitter validator: https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator
- LinkedIn inspector: https://www.linkedin.com/post-inspector/

### Step 4: Commit Documentation Changes ⏳
**Ground Rule Check**: Documentation-only changes can commit directly to main

**Files to commit:**

**Commit message:**
```

- Update install-bookmarklet.html to v1.0.4

```

**Git workflow:**
1. Git pull before commit to ensure local is current
2. Stage and commit files
3. **Requires explicit approval before commit**

### Step 5: Commit Screenshot Images (After Creation) ⏳
- Add BEFORE/AFTER screenshots to images/ folder
- Update documentation to reference new screenshots (if desired)
- Commit with message: "Assets: Add before/after app screenshots"
- **Requires explicit approval before commit**

### Step 6: Push to GitHub ⏳

## What is ReaderWrangler?

ReaderWrangler is a browser-based tool for organizing your ebook library. It consists of:

1. **Landing Page** ([index.html](index.html)) - Entry point with:
   - Quick Start instructions (4 simple steps)
   - Link to [install-bookmarklet.html](install-bookmarklet.html) - Install the data fetcher
   - Link to [readerwrangler.html](readerwrangler.html) - Launch the organizer (if bookmarklet already installed)

2. **Bookmarklet Installer** ([install-bookmarklet.html](install-bookmarklet.html)) - Installs the data fetching bookmarklet

3. **Organizer Application** ([readerwrangler.html](readerwrangler.html)) - Main drag-and-drop organization interface

4. **Data Fetchers** - Bookmarklet scripts that extract library data from Amazon

All processing happens in your browser - your data never leaves your computer.

## For Developers: Contributing to ReaderWrangler

There are two development workflows available, depending on whether you want instant local testing or prefer to test via GitHub Pages.

### Development Option A: Local Testing (Recommended)

**Best for:** Rapid iteration, instant feedback, testing bookmarklet changes

**Workflow:**
1. Clone the repository
2. Make your code changes
3. Start local HTTP server
4. Test immediately in browser
5. When satisfied, commit and push to GitHub

**Setup:**

1. **Start a local HTTP server** in the project directory:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Or with Python 2:
   ```bash
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
   ```

2. **Access your local instance:**
   - Landing page: http://localhost:8000/index.html
   - Installer: http://localhost:8000/install-bookmarklet.html
   - Organizer: http://localhost:8000/readerwrangler.html

3. **Why a local server?**

   Browsers block JavaScript from loading local files (like your library JSON) when opening HTML files directly (`file://` protocol). Running a local HTTP server (`http://localhost`) allows the application to access these files securely.

### Development Option B: GitHub Pages Testing

**Best for:** Testing deployment process, verifying production behavior, collaborative testing

**Workflow:**
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your code changes
4. Commit and push to GitHub
5. Configure GitHub Pages to serve your branch
6. Wait 1-5 minutes for GitHub to rebuild
7. Test at https://ron-l.github.io/readerwrangler/

**Setup:**

1. **Configure GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to repository Settings → Pages
   - Set Source to your branch (e.g., `feature-ux-landing-page-tweaks`)
   - GitHub Pages will rebuild and serve your branch

2. **Deployment delays:**
   - First deploy: ~2-5 minutes
   - Subsequent updates: ~1-3 minutes
   - No local server required

3. **Testing your changes:**
   - Visit https://ron-l.github.io/readerwrangler/
   - Cache may be stale - use hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
   - Or use incognito/private mode for clean testing

4. **When ready for production:**
   - Merge to `main` branch
   - Configure GitHub Pages to serve `main`
   - Changes appear at both github.io and readerwrangler.com URLs

**Note:** GitHub Pages caching is aggressive. During development, you may need to:
- Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Clear browser cache
- Use incognito/private browsing mode
- Wait a few minutes for GitHub's CDN to update

### Bookmarklet Development and Testing

The bookmarklet installer ([install-bookmarklet.html](install-bookmarklet.html)) is **environment-aware** and adapts to where it's running:

#### For End Users (Production)
When users visit the installer on **readerwrangler.com** or **GitHub Pages**, they see a single production bookmarklet:
- **📚 ReaderWrangler** (purple gradient)
- Points to production servers (readerwrangler.com or GitHub Pages)
- Optimized for performance with browser caching

#### For Developers (Localhost)
When you run the installer on **localhost:8000**, it automatically shows **BOTH** bookmarklets side-by-side:

1. **⚠️ DEV ReaderWrangler** (orange gradient)
   - Points exclusively to `localhost:8000`
   - Always loads fresh code (cache-busting enabled)
   - Use this when testing local changes on Amazon pages

2. **📚 ReaderWrangler** (purple gradient)
   - Points to production servers (readerwrangler.com/GitHub Pages)
   - Use this to compare production behavior vs your local changes

**Why two bookmarklets for developers?**

The bookmarklet runs *on Amazon's website*, not on our pages. When you click a bookmarklet on `amazon.com/yourbooks`, the JavaScript has no way to know if you're a developer with a local server running. It only sees Amazon's hostname.

Solution: Install both bookmarklets from the localhost installer. Now you can:
- Click **⚠️ DEV** to test your local changes
- Click **📚 Production** to verify production behavior
- Easily switch between them while testing on Amazon

**Testing workflow:**
1. Start local server: `python -m http.server 8000`
2. Visit `http://localhost:8000/install-bookmarklet.html`
3. Drag both bookmarklets to your bookmarks bar
4. Navigate to Amazon library page
5. Click **⚠️ DEV** bookmarklet to test local changes
6. (Optional) Click **📚 Production** to compare behavior

The installer detects its own environment using `window.location.hostname` and generates appropriate bookmarklet code dynamically.

## Development Workflow

### Setting Up Claude Skills

This project uses Claude Skills to maintain workflow consistency across sessions. Skills are specialized context files that Claude loads before each conversation.

**Required Skills:**
1. `software-development-ground-rules` (from SKILL-Development-Ground-Rules.zip)
   - Enable globally for all development projects
2. `readerwrangler-project` (from SKILL-ReaderWrangler.zip)
   - Enable per project when working on this codebase

**How to Enable:**
1. Upload both `.zip` files to Claude's Skills interface (Settings → Skills)
2. In each conversation, manually enable both skills
3. **Important:** Skills must be enabled for EACH new conversation

**Building Skill Zips:**

Skills are automatically rebuilt by git pre-commit hook when SKILL-*.md files are committed:
```bash
# Commit SKILL-*.md changes normally
git add SKILL-Development-Ground-Rules.md
git commit -m "Docs: Update ground rules"
# Hook automatically rebuilds the .zip files
```

Manual build (if hook fails):
```bash
build-skill-ground-rules.bat
build-skill-organizer.bat
```

**Updating Skills:**
1. Modify SKILL-*.md source files
2. Commit (hook rebuilds zips automatically)
3. Upload new .zip to Claude Skills interface (will prompt to replace existing)

### Core Ground Rules (Quick Reference)

For complete details, see SKILL-Development-Ground-Rules.md. Here's a quick reference:

#### Rule #1: Version Management
- **Version BEFORE code changes** (never modify code without incrementing version first)
- Exception: Documentation and meta files (README, CHANGELOG, TODO, NOTES, SKILL-*.md, .bat, .gitignore)
- **Starting new work**: Increment version number AND add letter (v3.2.0 → v3.2.1.a)
- **Iterating**: Increment letter only (v3.2.1.a → v3.2.1.b)
- **Releasing**: Remove letter (v3.2.1.c → v3.2.1)

#### Rule #2: Approval Workflow
- **STOP and ASK** before any code changes, commits, or git operations
- "Should we?", "thoughts?", "what do you think?" = DISCUSSION (not approval)
- Wait for explicit "yes", "go ahead", "proceed" before executing
- "Proceed with edits" = Edit ONLY, then STOP
- "Proceed with commit" = Commit ONLY, then STOP
- When in doubt, do ONE operation and STOP

#### Rule #3: Update Before Commit
- Always run `git fetch` before committing
- Check for conflicts and resolve before pushing

#### Rule Enforcement Protocol
Before rule-sensitive actions, explicitly check the relevant rule:
- State: "**Checking Ground Rule #N...**"
- Quote current state and relevant pattern
- Show reasoning
- Then execute

This visible checking ensures rules are actively applied, not just available in context.

### Git Workflow

#### Feature Development
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature-name`
2. Make incremental commits with letter versions (v3.1.0.a, v3.1.0.b, etc.)
3. When ready to release, squash all letter-versioned commits into one
4. Update to release version (remove letter), merge to main
5. Tag: `git tag v3.2.1` (use actual version)
6. Push: `git push origin main --tags`

#### Documentation-Only Changes
- Can be committed directly to main (no feature branch)
- No version increment or tagging required
- Still requires approval before commit/push (Rule #2)

#### Commit Strategy: Refinement vs Exploration

**When to squash commits:**
- Refining a single approach (bug fixes, polish, incremental improvements)
- Commit messages like "Fix bug in X", "Improve Y performance"
- Final version is what matters, not the iteration path

**When to keep separate commits:**
- Exploring multiple distinct approaches (Option A, B, C)
- Each option represents a different design decision
- Commit messages like "Try Option 1: Approach X", "Implement Option 2: Approach Y"
- Design evolution history is valuable for future understanding
- Easy rollback to specific options if needed

**Rule of thumb:**
- Ask: "Is this a different *approach* or a *refinement*?"
- Different approach → Keep separate commits
- Refinement → Can squash

**Checkpoints:**
- Always create checkpoint tags before major design pivots
- Format: `checkpoint-pre-<feature-name>` or `checkpoint-option-<N>`

#### Commit Messages
Format: `Type: Brief description`

Types: Feat, Fix, Update, Refactor, Docs, Test, Chore, Rename

Include version in subject line: `Fix: Resolve manifest caching issue v3.0.0.p`

### Project Version Management

- Project version tracked in README.md (format: "Project Version: vX.Y.Z")
- Increments ONLY for code/executable changes (not documentation-only)
- Based on release nature:
  - Major (X): Breaking changes or major feature sets
  - Minor (Y): New features or significant improvements
  - Patch (Z): Bug fixes, minor improvements
- Git tags MUST match project version
- Use "v" prefix for consistency
- Tags mark released versions only (not letter versions)

### Communication Guidelines

#### Foundation-First Principle
The user prioritizes fixing foundations before building features. This is a deliberate pattern based on 40 years of experience, not a distraction.

When user identifies foundational issues:
1. Don't apologize for "going off track" - this IS the track
2. Embrace the detour as investment in future velocity
3. Ask: "Should we fix this foundation issue before continuing?"
4. Wait for explicit decision

Examples: Fix rules BEFORE implementing features, clarify docs BEFORE adding new docs, improve patterns BEFORE fixing specific bugs

#### Ship Fast vs. Build Solid: Decision Framework

When evaluating bugs or feature requests, use this decision tree to determine the appropriate approach:

**KEY QUESTION: "Does this affect data correctness or completeness?"**

**Ship Fast When:**
- UI polish issues (colors, spacing, minor UX tweaks)
- Nice-to-have features (additional sorting options, filter variations)
- Performance optimizations (unless critical to usability)
- Edge cases affecting <0.01% with NO data loss or corruption
- Cosmetic improvements that don't affect core functionality

**Build Solid Foundation When:**
- ✅ **Data integrity issues** (loss, corruption, incorrect processing)
- ✅ **Core functionality bugs** (search, filtering, display, organization)
- ✅ **API contract changes** (endpoint deprecation, schema changes)
- ✅ **State management bugs** (persistence, ID stability, synchronization)
- ✅ **Error handling gaps** (silent failures, missing validation)

**Context Considerations:**

This project requires the "Build Solid" approach because:
1. **Library management** - Users trust us with their book collection metadata
2. **Long-term use** - Not a throwaway prototype, built for ongoing use
3. **Data permanence** - Books represent purchased content, reading history
4. **Cross-session reliability** - Must work consistently over months/years
5. **Foundation compounds** - Solid patterns prevent future issues

**Comparison to Other Contexts:**
- Social media prototype: 3/2000 missing posts? Ship it.
- E-commerce recommendations: 3 products don't load? Ship it.
- Financial transactions: 3 failed transfers? NEVER ship.
- **Personal library manager: 3 missing books?** → Closer to financial than social media.

**Time Investment Criteria:**

A few days investigating to achieve:
- 100% data coverage instead of 99.85%
- Understanding of API behavior patterns
- Robust error handling for future edge cases
- Comprehensive logging for rapid future diagnosis

...is **proportional and justified** for a library management system.

**Red Herrings and Learning:**

If an investigation takes unexpected turns but yields:
- Fixed bugs (even if different than expected)
- Documented API behavior
- Improved error handling
- Transferable knowledge for future issues

...then it was **NOT wasted time** - it was education and foundation building.

**Application:**
Before starting work on any bug or feature, explicitly evaluate it against this framework and document the decision reasoning.

#### Project Context Assessment
Before starting any new project or major feature, assess:
- **Lifespan:** Weekend hack or long-term project?
- **Scope trajectory:** Fixed or likely to grow?
- **Team size:** Solo or collaborative?
- **Consequences:** Cost of bugs?
- **Certainty:** Requirements clear or being discovered?

**This project is Foundation First:**
- Long lifespan (ongoing development)
- Growing complexity (collections, tracking, features)
- Collaborative (user + Claude across sessions)
- Real consequences (managing 2666 books)
- Clear requirements, known direction

## Architecture Notes

### Version Management Pattern
- Single source: `APP_VERSION` constant in readerwrangler.js
- Browser title updates dynamically from constant
- Query string cache busting: `?v=3.2.0`
- Footer version display
- Version comments in all files

### Data Flow
- User loads library → Parse JSON → Store in IndexedDB
- UI state (columns, positions) → localStorage
- Manifest polling → Compare totalBooks → Update status

### Status Icons (Critical Pattern)
- Pre-load ALL 5 icons in DOM simultaneously
- Toggle visibility with CSS `display: none/inline-block`
- **NEVER change `src` attribute** (causes 30-60s browser lag)
- See CHANGELOG Technical Notes for failed approaches

### Common Pitfalls
See SKILL-ReaderWrangler.md and CHANGELOG Technical Notes for:
- Icon display lag solutions
- Manifest caching workarounds
- Ground rule violation patterns

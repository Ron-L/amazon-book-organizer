# Session Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **START HERE - Session Startup Checklist** ‚ö†Ô∏è

Before doing ANYTHING in this session, confirm:
- [ ] Skills are enabled: software-development-ground-rules & amazon-book-organizer-project
- [ ] You have READ the Core Rules in SKILL-Development-Ground-Rules.md (lines 8-29)
- [ ] You understand: Version BEFORE code changes, Approval BEFORE actions
- [ ] When user says "yes"/"go ahead"/"proceed" = approval. Discussion ‚â† approval.

If you haven't done the above, STOP and read those SKILL files NOW.

---

‚ö†Ô∏è **RELEASE WORKFLOW - Follow this checklist when finalizing ANY version** ‚ö†Ô∏è

BEFORE starting work:
- [ ] Present COMPLETE plan (all files, all steps) to user for approval
- [ ] Identify which files need version updates (only files being changed)
- [ ] Determine project version increment (README.md)

Before running `git tag`:
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with version entry and technical notes
- [ ] NOTES.md Current Work in Progress updated (change to RELEASED ‚úÖ)
- [ ] TODO.md tasks marked complete
- [ ] Version suffix removed (e.g., .a ‚Üí final version) in ALL updated files
- [ ] README.md project version updated
- [ ] **STOP: Present this checklist to user for review and get explicit approval before proceeding**
- [ ] All changes committed to feature branch
- [ ] Merged to main
- [ ] THEN and ONLY THEN: git tag, git push --tags

AFTER release:
- [ ] Conduct post-mortem review with user
- [ ] Document lessons learned in NOTES.md

This file tracks tabled discussion items, work in progress context, and open questions to maintain continuity across Claude sessions.

## Tabled Items

### Column Name Filtering Feature
- **Date**: 2025-10-17
- **Context**: User has an idea about filtering that also involves filtering column names
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Moved to TODO.md with documented approaches (simple case, prefix syntax, smart filtering)
- **Priority**: Pending user decision on next task priority

## Current Work in Progress

### Collections & Read Status Integration - HTML Refactor Phase
- **Started**: 2025-10-19
- **Branch**: feature-html-refactor (to be created from main)
- **Context**: Refactor HTML before integrating collections data
- **Status**: üî® IN PROGRESS - Refactoring HTML structure

**Background:**
- User marks finished books as "Read" in Amazon collections
- Collections fetcher complete: `collections-fetcher.js` successfully fetches all 2,280 books
- Generated `amazon-collections.json` (505 KB) with collection membership and read status
- Amazon FIONA API endpoint: `https://www.amazon.com/hz/mycd/digital-console/ajax`

**Current Phase - HTML Refactor:**
1. Split `amazon-organizer.html` into modular files:
   - `amazon-organizer.css` (extracted styles)
   - `amazon-organizer.js` (extracted scripts)
   - Minimal HTML shell
2. Merge refactor to main as v3.2.0
3. Pull refactored code into feature-collection-read-status-exploration
4. Then integrate collections data on clean codebase

**Integration Plan (after refactor):**
1. Visual indicators on book covers (badge/icon for collections)
2. Metadata display for each book (show which collections)
3. Filterable attribute (filter by collection/read status)

**Key Decisions:**
- Two separate JSON files: `amazon-library.json` + `amazon-collections.json` (merged in HTML)
- "Uncollected" computed as pseudo-collection (books with `collections: []`)
- Separate branch for refactor (cleaner history, independent release)

**Collections Fetcher Stats:**
- Total books: 2,280 (fetched in 3m 56s)
- Books with collections: 1,399 (61%)
- Books without collections: 881 (39%)
- Read status: 722 READ, 1 UNREAD, 1,557 UNKNOWN

### v3.1.2 - RELEASED ‚úÖ
- **Started**: 2025-10-18
- **Completed**: 2025-10-18
- **Released**: 2025-10-18
- **Branch**: feature-improve-error-messages (merged to main)
- **Changes Made**:
  - Improved console fetcher Phase 0 error messages with actionable recovery steps
  - Authentication/session expiration errors now tell users exactly what to do
  - No functional changes, only improved user guidance
- **Status**: Successfully merged to main, tagged as v3.1.2, and pushed to GitHub

### v3.1.1 - RELEASED ‚úÖ
- **Started**: 2025-10-17
- **Completed**: 2025-10-17
- **Released**: 2025-10-17
- **Branch**: feature-column-rename-trigger (merged to main)
- **Changes Made**:
  - Added pencil icon (‚úèÔ∏è) that appears on hover over column names
  - Icon fades in smoothly to indicate editability
  - Double-click functionality already existed, this improves discoverability
- **Status**: Successfully merged to main, tagged as v3.1.1, and pushed to GitHub
- **Lesson Learned**: During this session, Claude violated BOTH Core Ground Rules:
  - Rule #1 (Version Management): Made code changes BEFORE incrementing version - must increment BEFORE any code edit
  - Rule #2 (Approval Workflow): Made multiple changes without waiting for explicit "yes"/"go ahead"/"proceed" approval
  - After being called out and re-reading BOTH SKILL files, behavior significantly improved
  - Root cause: Not thoroughly processing the SKILL files before starting work
  - **For future sessions**: The startup checklist at the top of this file is mandatory

### v3.1.0 - RELEASED ‚úÖ
- **Started**: 2025-10-17
- **Completed**: 2025-10-17
- **Released**: 2025-10-17
- **Branch**: feature-ux-improvements (merged to main)
- **Changes Made**:
  - Dynamic title management (title auto-updates from APP_VERSION constant)
  - Search bar improvements (magnifying glass icon, better placeholder)
  - Add Column UX redesign (button creates "New Column" with cursor ready)
  - README updates (server documentation, Skills documentation)
  - Created Claude Skills infrastructure (SKILL-*.md files, build scripts)
  - Created NOTES.md for session continuity
  - Established README.md as source of truth for git tags
- **Status**: Successfully merged to main, tagged as v3.1.0, and pushed to GitHub

## Notes About This File

- **Purpose**: Maintains context across Claude sessions, especially for "tabled" discussion items
- **Commit Policy**: Always commit NOTES.md with any other changes (for backup)
- **Version Control**: Tracked in git but does NOT trigger app version increments
- **Update Frequency**: Update whenever items are tabled or work context changes significantly

# Session Notes

⚠️ **START HERE - Session Startup Checklist** ⚠️

Before doing ANYTHING in this session, confirm:
- [ ] Skills are enabled: software-development-ground-rules & amazon-book-organizer-project
- [ ] You have READ the Core Rules in SKILL-Development-Ground-Rules.md (lines 8-29)
- [ ] You understand: Version BEFORE code changes, Approval BEFORE actions
- [ ] When user says "yes"/"go ahead"/"proceed" = approval. Discussion ≠ approval.

If you haven't done the above, STOP and read those SKILL files NOW.

This file tracks tabled discussion items, work in progress context, and open questions to maintain continuity across Claude sessions.

## Tabled Items

### Column Name Filtering Feature
- **Date**: 2025-10-17
- **Context**: User has an idea about filtering that also involves filtering column names
- **Status**: Deferred for later discussion
- **Priority**: TBD

## Current Work in Progress

### v3.1.1 - IN PROGRESS ⚙️
- **Started**: 2025-10-17
- **Branch**: feature-column-rename-trigger
- **Changes Made**:
  - Added pencil icon (✏️) that appears on hover over column names
  - Icon fades in smoothly to indicate editability
  - Double-click functionality already existed, this improves discoverability
- **Status**: Testing v3.1.1.a completed, ready to finalize
- **Lesson Learned**: During this session, Claude violated BOTH Core Ground Rules:
  - Rule #1 (Version Management): Made code changes BEFORE incrementing version - must increment BEFORE any code edit
  - Rule #2 (Approval Workflow): Made multiple changes without waiting for explicit "yes"/"go ahead"/"proceed" approval
  - After being called out and re-reading BOTH SKILL files, behavior significantly improved
  - Root cause: Not thoroughly processing the SKILL files before starting work
  - **For future sessions**: The startup checklist at the top of this file is mandatory

### v3.1.0 - RELEASED ✅

- **Completed**: 2025-10-17
- **Released**: 2025-10-17

- **Changes Made**:
  - Dynamic title management (title auto-updates from APP_VERSION constant)

  - README updates (server documentation, Skills documentation)
  - Created Claude Skills infrastructure (SKILL-*.md files, build scripts)
  - Created NOTES.md for session continuity

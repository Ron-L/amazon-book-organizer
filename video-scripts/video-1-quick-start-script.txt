===== SCENE 1: Landing Page (0:00-0:20) =====

Have hundreds of Kindle books... but can never find what to read next?

Amazon shows you all your books... but won't let you organize them.

ReaderWrangler fixes that.

In the next two minutes... you'll extract your entire Kindle library from Amazon... and organize it however you want.

Let's get started.

===== SCENE 2: Install Bookmarklet (0:20-0:45) =====

First... visit ReadyWrangler dot com and click "Get Started."

You'll see a button that says "ReaderWrangler Navigator."

Just drag it to your bookmarks bar.

That's it. Installation done.

This bookmarklet is your control panel... for everything that follows.

===== SCENE 3: Fetch Library (0:45-1:30) =====

Now click the bookmarklet.

A menu appears. Select "Go to Library Fetcher Amazon Page."

You're now on Amazon's "Your Books" page.

Click the bookmarklet again... and select "Fetch Library Data."

The bookmarklet starts extracting your books... covers... ratings... reviews... everything.

The browser console shows progress as it works.

For a smaller library... this goes pretty quickly.

For larger libraries with hundreds or thousands of books... grab a coffee. It takes time to extract everything properly.

When it's done... a JSON file downloads automatically to your computer.

That's your entire library... ready to organize.

===== SCENE 4: Fetch Collections (1:30-1:50) =====

One more quick step.

Click the bookmarklet... and select "Go to Collections Fetcher Amazon Page."

Click the bookmarklet again... and select "Fetch Collections Data."

This grabs your reading status... which books you've finished... which ones are in progress.

Another JSON file downloads.

Now you have everything.

===== SCENE 5: Launch App & Organize (1:50-2:45) =====

Click the bookmarklet one last time... and select "Launch App."

Click the gray "No Library" text at the top... and load the JSON file you just downloaded.

Boom. There's your entire library.

Now the fun part.

Create a column by clicking "New Column." Name it "Next to Read."

Drag books into it.

Create another column. "Finished Books."

Drag some more.

Use search to find a specific author... then drag all their books to a new "Favorite Authors" column.

Click any book to see full details... ratings... reviews... descriptions.

Everything from Amazon... now organized your way.

===== SCENE 6: Wrap Up (2:45-3:00) =====

That's it.

Your books... your order... finally.

Everything runs in your browser. Your data never leaves your computer.

Start wrangling your reading chaos... today.

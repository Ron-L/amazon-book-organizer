# Phase 3 Retry Logic - Design Document

**Feature**: Import Improvements - Phase 3 (v3.4.0)
**Status**: Approved, Not Started
**Created**: 2025-11-24

## Goal

Progressive data completeness improvement through retry logic for books with missing review data.

---

## Problem Statement

Amazon sometimes fails to return review data for some books. This is an intermittent backend issue on Amazon's side, not a bug in our code.

**Current Statistics**:
- 31/2344 books (1.3%) missing topReviews
- 3 books consistently fail (Cats + 2 Queens) - Amazon backend permanently broken
- ~28 books fail intermittently - should resolve on retry
- Expected final success rate after Phase 3: ~99.8% (2,341/2,344 books)
- Only 2 books with 500+ reviews missing data (0.1%) - not correlated with review count

## Design

### When to Retry

1. **After Phase 2 enrichment completes** (fresh import) - immediate retry opportunity
2. **When user refreshes existing library** - progressive improvement over time

### How It Works

1. **Scan library** for books with `reviewCount > 0` but `topReviews.length === 0`
2. **Retry using same configuration**:
   - Wait 5-10 minutes after initial import (allow Amazon backend state to change)
   - Retry same ASIN up to 3 times total
   - Track retry statistics in book metadata:
     - `reviewFetchAttempts`
     - `reviewFetchStatus`
     - `lastReviewFetchAttempt`
3. **Merge successful review data** back into library
4. **Update metadata** with retry statistics

## Benefits

| Scenario | Benefit |
|----------|---------|
| Fresh import | Immediate retry - servers might succeed on 2nd attempt due to randomness |
| Refresh | Progressive improvement - Amazon's server state changes over time |
| User expectation | Loading library file should update missing data if possible |

---

## Implementation Notes

- Reuses existing enrichment query infrastructure
- No new authentication required
- Metadata tracking enables future reporting on retry effectiveness
- Graceful degradation - if retries fail, data quality is no worse than before

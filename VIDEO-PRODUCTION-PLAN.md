# ReaderWrangler Video Production Plan

## Text-to-Speech Service Selection

### Services Evaluated
- **ElevenLabs**: 10K chars/month free (natural, professional, limited free tier)
- **Microsoft Azure TTS**: 500K chars/month free (very natural Neural voices)
- **TTSMaker**: Unlimited free (surprisingly good, no signup)
- **Google Cloud TTS**: 1M chars/month free (Neural2/Journey voices)

### Selected Service: Google Cloud Text-to-Speech

**Reasons for Selection:**
1. **Free tier covers production needs**: 1M characters/month = 5+ hours of narration
2. **Professional quality**: Neural2 and Journey voices are indistinguishable from human
3. **Voice consistency**: Same voice guaranteed across all videos forever
4. **Journey voices**: Specifically designed for long-form tutorial narration
5. **Service stability**: Google isn't going anywhere
6. **Scalability**: Very affordable if we exceed free tier ($16 per 1M additional characters)

**Recommended Voices:**
- `en-US-Journey-D` (male, warm, conversational)
- `en-US-Journey-F` (female, friendly, clear)

**Demo/Testing:**
- Try voices at: https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech#demo
- Production access: Create free Google Cloud account

## Video Series Plan

### Target Audience Needs
- **Problem**: Users bounce if forced to watch 10-minute walkthrough
- **Solution**: Multiple short, focused tutorials (2-3 minutes each)
- **Budget**: ~1 hour total narration in first month (well within 5+ hour free tier)

### Planned Videos

#### 1. Quick Start (2-3 minutes)
**Goal**: Get users from zero to organized library in under 3 minutes
**Status**: High priority - replaces 10-minute walkthrough for initial onboarding

#### 2. Installing the Bookmarklet (1-2 minutes)
**Goal**: Show exactly how to install and what to expect

#### 3. Fetching Your Library (2-3 minutes)
**Goal**: Navigate Amazon, run fetcher, understand progress

#### 4. Fetching Collections (1-2 minutes)
**Goal**: Quick walkthrough of collections fetch process

#### 5. Organizing Your Books (3-4 minutes)
**Goal**: Creating columns, drag-drop, multi-select, searching
**Note**: Should cover double-click detail view (missing from 10-minute video)

#### 6. Advanced Features (2-3 minutes)
**Goal**: Filtering, backup/restore, keyboard shortcuts

## Video Production Workflow

### Per-Video Structure

Each video needs:
1. **Script** - Formatted for TTS (conversational, proper pauses)
2. **Screen Direction** - Exact actions to perform on screen
3. **Scene Prep** - Required state before recording (clear library, specific books loaded, etc.)
4. **Timing Notes** - Sync narration with screen actions

### Script Formatting for TTS

**Best Practices:**
- Use periods for natural pauses (not commas only)
- Add `...` for longer dramatic pauses
- Use contractions ("you'll" not "you will")
- Break long sentences into shorter ones
- Add phonetic spellings in parentheses if needed
- Speed: 0.9x for instructional content (slower = clearer)

## Video 1: Quick Start (HIGH PRIORITY)

### Target Length
2-3 minutes

### Audience
Brand new users who need to get started fast

### Goal
Take user from "I just found ReaderWrangler" to "I have my organized library"

### Scene Prep

**Before Recording:**
- Clear browser downloads folder (or note existing files to avoid confusion)
- Have Amazon account ready (logged in)
- Browser: Chrome/Edge with bookmarks bar visible
- Have install-bookmarklet.html page ready to open
- Clear any existing ReaderWrangler data in browser (fresh start)

**Test Library State:**
- Use real Amazon account with at least 50-100 books for demonstration
- Ensure library includes mix of genres, ratings, and authors
- Should have some recognizable titles viewers might relate to

### Script (TTS-Optimized)

**[SCENE 1: Landing Page - 0:00-0:20]**

Have hundreds of Kindle books... but can never find what to read next?

Amazon shows you all your books... but won't let you organize them.

ReaderWrangler fixes that.

In the next two minutes... you'll extract your entire Kindle library from Amazon... and organize it however you want.

Let's get started.

---

**[SCENE 2: Install Bookmarklet - 0:20-0:45]**

First... visit ReadyWrangler dot com and click "Get Started."

You'll see a button that says "ReaderWrangler Navigator."

Just drag it to your bookmarks bar.

That's it. Installation done.

This bookmarklet is your control panel... for everything that follows.

---

**[SCENE 3: Fetch Library - 0:45-1:30]**

Now click the bookmarklet.

A menu appears. Select "Go to Library Fetcher Amazon Page."

You're now on Amazon's "Your Books" page.

Click the bookmarklet again... and select "Fetch Library Data."

The bookmarklet starts extracting your books... covers... ratings... reviews... everything.

The browser console shows progress as it works.

For a smaller library... this goes pretty quickly.

For larger libraries with hundreds or thousands of books... grab a coffee. It takes time to extract everything properly.

When it's done... a JSON file downloads automatically to your computer.

That's your entire library... ready to organize.

---

**[SCENE 4: Fetch Collections - 1:30-1:50]**

One more quick step.

Click the bookmarklet... and select "Go to Collections Fetcher Amazon Page."

Click the bookmarklet again... and select "Fetch Collections Data."

This grabs your reading status... which books you've finished... which ones are in progress.

Another JSON file downloads.

Now you have everything.

---

**[SCENE 5: Launch App & Organize - 1:50-2:45]**

Click the bookmarklet one last time... and select "Launch App."

Click the gray "No Library" text at the top... and load the JSON file you just downloaded.

Boom. There's your entire library.

Now the fun part.

Create a column by clicking "New Column." Name it "Next to Read."

Drag books into it.

Create another column. "Finished Books."

Drag some more.

Use search to find a specific author... then drag all their books to a new "Favorite Authors" column.

Click any book to see full details... ratings... reviews... descriptions.

Everything from Amazon... now organized your way.

---

**[SCENE 6: Wrap Up - 2:45-3:00]**

That's it.

Your books... your order... finally.

Everything runs in your browser. Your data never leaves your computer.

Start wrangling your reading chaos... today.

### Production Notes

**Voice Selection Test:**
- Record this script with both Journey-D and Journey-F
- Listen for natural conversational flow
- Pick voice that sounds enthusiastic but not overly energetic
- Document choice below once decided

**Selected Voice**: [TBD after testing]

**Animation Highlights Needed:**
- Circle/arrow to highlight bookmarklet button
- Zoom on navigator menu when it appears
- Highlight on JSON files in Downloads folder
- Smooth drag animation (not jerky mouse movement)
- Visual indicator for multi-select (checkmarks)

**Potential Issues:**
- Amazon page load time (may need to cut/edit waiting)
- Console progress messages speed varies by library size (adjust time-lapse accordingly)
- Downloads folder appearance varies by OS (record on Windows/Mac/Linux?)

**Known Limitations (Current State of App):**
- **No visual progress indicator yet** - Script shows console output as workaround
- **Extraction time**: Currently ~1 hour per 1,000 books (not optimized yet)
- Video script intentionally vague ("grab a coffee" / "takes time") to avoid locking in specific numbers
- **TODO Items to Complete Before Final Video**:
  - Priority 2 #6: Enhanced Progress Feedback (visual progress bars, time estimates)
  - Performance optimization to speed up extraction
  - Once these are done, update script with specific timing guidance

### Follow-Up Video Ideas

Based on what we skip in Quick Start:
- **Video 2**: Deep dive on bookmarklet navigator (all menu options explained)
- **Video 3**: Advanced organization (multi-select, bulk operations, keyboard shortcuts)
- **Video 4**: Book detail modal features (navigation, filtering while in modal)
- **Video 5**: Backup/Restore and multi-device workflow
- **Video 6**: Collections integration and reading status tracking

# ProductHunt Launch Checklist

## What is ProductHunt?

ProductHunt is a community where makers share and discover new products. Getting featured on the homepage can bring thousands of visitors and valuable feedback.

**Free to use** - No cost to launch your product.

---

## Pre-Launch Preparation (2-3 weeks before)

### 1. Create ProductHunt Account
- [ ] Sign up at [ProductHunt.com](https://www.producthunt.com/)
- [ ] Complete your profile (photo, bio, social links)
- [ ] Engage with the community (upvote, comment on other products)
- [ ] **Important:** Don't launch immediately - spend 1-2 weeks being active first

### 2. Find a "Hunter" (Optional but Recommended)
- [ ] A "hunter" with followers can boost your launch
- [ ] Look for hunters interested in productivity/ebook tools
- [ ] Message them 1 week before launch asking if they'd hunt your product
- [ ] **Alternative:** You can self-hunt (post it yourself)

### 3. Prepare Assets

**Product Images:**
- [ ] **Thumbnail** (240x240px) - Logo or app icon
- [ ] **Hero image** (1270x760px) - Main screenshot showing the app in action
- [ ] **Gallery images** (up to 10, 1270x760px each):
  - Before/after organization screenshot
  - Drag-and-drop demo
  - Book detail view
  - Feature highlights

**GIF/Video:**
- [ ] **Demo GIF** or **YouTube video** (under 60 seconds)
- [ ] Show the core workflow: Install bookmarklet → Extract → Organize
- [ ] Keep it fast-paced and visually engaging

**Text:**
- [ ] **Tagline** (60 characters max): "Scrape & organize your Amazon Kindle library visually"
- [ ] **Description** (260 characters max): "Free tool to extract your Kindle library from Amazon and organize it with drag-and-drop columns. Create custom reading lists, find buried gems, and take control of your ebook chaos. 100% private."
- [ ] **Full description** (1-2 paragraphs explaining the problem and solution)
- [ ] **First comment** (your launch post - detailed explanation, see below)

### 4. Choose Launch Date & Time

**Best day to launch:**
- [ ] **Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday** (most traffic)
- [ ] **Avoid:** Weekends, Mondays, major holidays

**Best time to launch (Pacific Time):**
- [ ] **12:01 AM PT** - This gives you the full 24 hours to accumulate upvotes
- [ ] ProductHunt's day resets at midnight PT

### 5. Prepare Your Network
- [ ] Draft messages to friends/colleagues asking for support
- [ ] **Don't ask for upvotes explicitly** (against PH rules - ask them to "check it out")
- [ ] Post on your social media the morning of launch
- [ ] Email your network (if you have one)

---

Hey Product Hunters! 👋

I'm Ron, and I built ReaderWrangler to solve a problem that's been driving me crazy for years.

**The Problem:**
Like many book lovers, my Kindle library has grown to over 2,000 books. Amazon shows you beautiful thumbnails of all your books online, but there's a critical problem: you can't organize them. No custom sorting. No "Next to Read" pile. No way to group series together. With a massive library, great reads get completely buried.

**The Solution:**
ReaderWrangler is a free web app that extracts your complete Kindle library from Amazon (covers, ratings, reviews, descriptions) and lets you organize it visually with drag-and-drop.

**How it works:**
1. Install a simple bookmarklet (one-time, takes 10 seconds)
2. Click it to extract your library from Amazon (one-time, takes a few minutes)
3. Organize your books into custom columns: "Next to Read", "Time Travel Books", "Favorites", whatever makes sense to you
4. Search, multi-select, drag-and-drop to organize

**Privacy:**
100% client-side - your data never leaves your browser. No accounts, no servers, no tracking.

**Why I built it:**
I built this for myself because I was tired of scrolling through endless pages trying to remember what books I own. Now I have a visual dashboard where I can see everything and actually use my library.

It's completely free and open source: https://github.com/Ron-L/readerwrangler

Would love to hear your feedback - especially if you have a massive ebook collection like me!

What features would make this more useful for you?

## ProductHunt Best Practices

**DO:**
- ✅ Be authentic and humble
- ✅ Engage genuinely with every commenter
- ✅ Share your story (why you built it)
- ✅ Ask for feedback, not upvotes
- ✅ Be active in the community before launch
- ✅ Respond quickly (especially first 4 hours)
- ✅ Share on social media naturally

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Ask people to upvote (against rules, will get you banned)
- ❌ Use bots or fake accounts
- ❌ Disappear after posting (stay engaged all day)
- ❌ Be defensive about criticism (listen and learn)
- ❌ Spam other products' comments with your link
- ❌ Launch on a weekend or Monday
- ❌ Post and ghost - engagement is key

🚀 I just launched ReaderWrangler on @ProductHunt!

A free tool to scrape & organize your Amazon Kindle library visually.

**LinkedIn:**
```
Excited to share that I've launched ReaderWrangler on ProductHunt today!

It's a free tool that solves a problem I've had for years: organizing a massive Kindle library.

Amazon shows you beautiful thumbnails of your books, but won't let you organize them. ReaderWrangler extracts your library and gives you drag-and-drop organization.

Built it for myself, sharing it with anyone who has an overwhelming ebook collection.

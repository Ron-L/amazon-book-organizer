## Getting Started

### Running the Application

Due to browser security restrictions (CORS policy), you need to run a local web server to use the application:

1. **Start a local HTTP server** in the project directory:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Or with Python 2:
   ```bash
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
   ```

2. **Open your browser** and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/amazon-organizer.html
   ```

3. **Load your library**: Click the status indicator at the top to load your Amazon library JSON file

4. **Start organizing**: Drag books into custom columns to organize your collection!

### Why a local server?

Browsers block JavaScript from loading local files (like your library JSON) when opening HTML files directly (`file://` protocol). Running a local HTTP server (`http://localhost`) allows the application to access these files securely.

## Files

- `amazon-organizer.html` - Main application HTML shell (v3.2.0)
- `amazon-organizer.js` - Application JavaScript (v3.2.0)
- `amazon-organizer.css` - Application styles (v3.2.0)
- `console-fetcher.js` - Library data fetching utility (v1.2.0)
- `collections-fetcher.js` - Collections data fetching utility (v1.0.0)
- `amazon-book-organizer.code-workspace` - VS Code workspace configuration

## Development with Claude

This project uses **Claude Skills** to maintain development workflow consistency across sessions. If you're working with Claude on this project:

### Required Skills

Two skill files must be uploaded to Claude and enabled for this project:

1. **software-development-ground-rules** (`SKILL-Development-Ground-Rules.zip`)
   - Core development workflow rules
   - Version management, approval workflow, git patterns
   - **Enable globally** for all development projects

2. **amazon-book-organizer-project** (`SKILL-Amazon-Book-Organizer.zip`)
   - Project-specific context and architecture patterns
   - Common pitfalls and solutions
   - **Enable per project** when working on Amazon Book Organizer

### How to Enable Skills

1. Upload both `.zip` files to Claude's Skills interface (Settings â†’ Skills)
2. In each conversation, enable the relevant skills:
   - Always enable: `software-development-ground-rules`
   - Enable for this project: `amazon-book-organizer-project`

**Important**: Skills must be manually enabled for each new conversation. Forgetting to enable them will result in inconsistent development patterns.

### Updating Skills

When the source files (`SKILL-*.md`) are modified, the zip files are automatically regenerated by a git pre-commit hook:

1. **Make changes** to SKILL-*.md files as needed
2. **Commit normally** - the git hook automatically rebuilds the .zip files
   - You'll see: "ðŸ”¨ Pre-commit hook: Rebuilding SKILL zip files..."
   - No manual action required
3. **Upload to Claude Skills interface**:
   - Drag and drop the new `.zip` file onto the Skills page
   - If the skill name already exists, it will prompt to replace it
   - No need to manually delete the old skill first

**Manual build scripts** (if git hook fails):
```bash
build-skill-ground-rules.bat
build-skill-organizer.bat
```

**Note**: The git pre-commit hook (`.git/hooks/pre-commit`) is repository-local and not tracked by git. If you clone to a new location, you'll need to recreate it or use the manual build scripts

### Key Documents

- `CHANGELOG.md` - Contains Technical Notes documenting approaches that failed (prevents revisiting blind alleys)
- `TODO.md` - Current tasks and pending improvements
- `NOTES.md` - Session continuity file for tabled items and work-in-progress context
- `SKILL-Development-Ground-Rules.md` - Source for the ground rules skill
- `SKILL-Amazon-Book-Organizer.md` - Source for the project skill
- `build-skill-*.bat` - Scripts to regenerate Skills zip files

## Version

**Project Version: v3.2.0**

This is the project-level version used for git tags. Individual code files may have their own internal versions (e.g., `APP_VERSION` in amazon-organizer.js, version comments in CSS/JS files).

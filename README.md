## Wrangle your reader chaos - Your books, your order

ReaderWrangler™ helps you organize and rediscover your ebook library. With hundreds or thousands of books in your collection, great reads get buried and forgotten. ReaderWrangler lets you create custom groups like "Next to Read" or "Time Travel Books," drag and drop books into organized columns, and double-click any cover to see full details, ratings, and reviews—so you never lose track of what to read next.

## Why ReaderWrangler?

**Unbury your next great read.**

If you're like most book lovers, your ebook library has grown to hundreds—even thousands—of books. You buy new titles faster than you can read them, and buried in that digital pile are gems you've completely forgotten about. That book you were excited to read last year? Lost in the shuffle. The entire series you meant to binge? Scattered and out of order.

**Amazon shows you all your books, but won't let you organize them.**

Amazon's "Your Books" page displays beautiful thumbnails with ratings and reviews, but there's a critical problem: you can't reorder them or group them in meaningful ways. With a massive library, it's impossible to keep track of what you own, what you've read, and what's next on your list.

**ReaderWrangler gives you the control Amazon doesn't.**

ReaderWrangler is a free web app that transforms your Amazon library into an organized, personalized reading dashboard. Using a simple bookmarklet, you download your complete Amazon library along with cover images, ratings, reviews, and descriptions.

Then the magic happens: **you** create custom columns like "Next to Read," "Favorites," "Time Travel Books," or "Beach Reads"—whatever makes sense for you. Drag and drop books between columns, reorder them within groups, and use multi-select to move entire series at once. Search by author or title to quickly find and organize specific books.

Double-click any book cover to see its full details—larger cover image, title, author, Amazon rating, description, and top reviews—then navigate through your filtered results without leaving the detail view.

**Your books, your order. Finally.**

Rediscover forgotten treasures, prioritize your reading stack, and organize the chaos into a system that actually works for you. ReaderWrangler runs entirely in your browser—your library data stays private and local. Never lose track of what to read next. Take command of your reading life.

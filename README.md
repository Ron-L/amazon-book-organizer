## Why ReaderWrangler?

**Unbury your next great read.**

If you're like most book lovers, your ebook library has grown to hundreds—even thousands—of books. You buy new titles faster than you can read them, and buried in that digital pile are gems you've completely forgotten about. That book you were excited to read last year? Lost in the shuffle. The entire series you meant to binge? Scattered and out of order.

**Amazon shows you all your books online, but won't let you organize them.**

Amazon's online "Your Books" page displays beautiful thumbnails with ratings and reviews, but there's a critical problem: you can't reorder them or group them in meaningful ways. With a massive library, it's impossible to keep track of what you own, what you've read, and what's next on your list.

**ReaderWrangler gives you the control Amazon doesn't.**

ReaderWrangler is a free web app that transforms your online Amazon Kindle library into an organized, personalized reading dashboard. Using a simple bookmarklet, when you click it, you extract your complete online Amazon Kindle library along with cover images, ratings, reviews, and descriptions.

Then the magic happens: **you** create custom columns like "Next to Read," "Favorites," "Time Travel Books," or "Beach Reads"—whatever makes sense for you. Drag and drop books between columns, reorder them within groups, and use multi-select to move entire series at once. Search by author or title to quickly find and organize specific books.

Double-click any book cover to see its full details—larger cover image, title, author, Amazon rating, description, and top reviews—then navigate through your filtered results without leaving the detail view.

**Your books, your order. Finally.**

Rediscover forgotten treasures, prioritize your reading stack, and organize the chaos into a system that actually works for you. ReaderWrangler runs entirely in your browser—your library data stays private and local. Never lose track of what to read next. Take command of your reading life.

## What Makes ReaderWrangler Different?

ReaderWrangler is the **only tool specifically designed for Amazon Kindle libraries**. While other excellent ebook management tools exist, they all require local ebook files—meaning you need to download, export, or manually manage files on your computer. ReaderWrangler takes a completely different approach.

### Unique to ReaderWrangler

**The only tool for Amazon Kindle libraries**
All other ebook organizers require local files. ReaderWrangler extracts and organizes your online Amazon Kindle library directly—no files to download, no exports to manage.

**Zero installation required**
While competitors require Docker, Python, CLI tools, or desktop applications, ReaderWrangler is just a bookmarklet and a webpage. Visit, drag, click, organize. That's it.

**100% client-side privacy**
Other tools require self-hosted servers or cloud uploads. ReaderWrangler processes everything in your browser—your data never leaves your computer.

**No technical knowledge needed**
No command line. No configuration files. No server setup. If you can drag a bookmark and click a button, you can use ReaderWrangler.

**Complementary, not competitive**
ReaderWrangler doesn't replace file-based ebook managers—it complements them. Use tools like Calibre or organize-ebooks for your local files, and use ReaderWrangler for your Amazon Kindle library.
